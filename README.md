# Code-generation-models

# Description:
Code generation models are a type of generative model trained to generate code in a specific programming language based on natural language descriptions or code snippets. These models can assist developers by automating code writing, auto-completing code, or generating entire functions based on a description. We can leverage pre-trained models like GPT-2 or specialized models like Codex (a variant of GPT-3) to generate code from prompts.

In this project, we will use GPT-2 to generate code based on simple natural language prompts.


# âœ… What It Does:
* Code generation using a pre-trained GPT-2 model.

* Given a natural language prompt, the model generates a Python code snippet that matches the description.

* This can be extended for various programming languages and more complex code generation tasks.

# Key features:
* Temperature and top-p sampling help control the creativity of the generated code. Lower values make the code more predictable and deterministic, while higher values lead to more diverse generation.

* The model can generate short functions or code snippets based on a simple description.
